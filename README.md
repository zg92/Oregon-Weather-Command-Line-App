# oregon_weather_searcher
This program is a command line tool that uses Open Weather's API to provide searchable weather data for Oregon.  I have found it useful for seeing where certain types of weather will be occuring so I can make travel plans. Current searched locations make up weather zones in proximity to interesting locations such as mountains, the coast, or desert. If you wish to add new locations, simply update the json file using the already existing template. To use this program, you will need an API key from https://openweathermap.org/.

NOTE: after using -g command to gather data, you do not need to use this command again unless you wish to call on the API for new data. You can use '-h' in the command line to see available commands.
