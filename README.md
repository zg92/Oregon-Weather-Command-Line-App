# oregon_weather_searcher
A command line tool that uses Open Weather's API to provide searchable weather data for Oregon. Current searched locations make up weather zones in proximity to interesting locations such as mountains, the coast, or desert. If you wish to add new locations, simply update the json file using the already existing template.
